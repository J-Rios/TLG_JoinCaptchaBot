Also, any message that contains a URL sent by a new \"user\" before the captcha is completed, will be considered spam and will be deleted.\n\nRemember to give me administration privileges to kick-ban users and remove messages.\n\nCheck /help command for more information about my usage.\n\nAm I useful?
