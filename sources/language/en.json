        "Hello, I am a Bot that send an image captcha for each new user who joins a group, and kick anyone that can't solve the captcha within a specified time.\n\nIf a user tries to join the group 5 times in a row and never solves the captcha, I will assume that this \"user\" is a bot, and it will be banned. Also, any message that contains a URL sent by a new \"user\" before the captcha is completed, will be considered spam and will be deleted.\n\nRemember to give me administration privileges to kick-ban users and remove messages.\n\nCheck /help command for more information about my usage.\n\nAm I useful? Check /about command and consider making a donation to keep me active.",

        "Bot help:\n————————————————\n- I am a Bot that send a captcha for each new user who joins a group, and kick anyof them that can't solve the captcha within a specified time.\n\n- If a user tries to join the group 5 times in a row and never solves the captcha, I will assume that the \"user\" is a bot, and it will be banned.\n\n- Any message that contains an URL that has been sent by a new \"user\" before captcha is completed, will be considered spam and will be deleted.\n\n- You need to grant me Administration rights for kick users and remove messages.\n\n- To preserve a clean group, I auto-remove all messages related to me when a captcha is not solved and the user was kicked (after 5 minutes).\n\n- The time that new users have to solve the captcha is 5 minutes by default, but it can be configured using the command /time.\n\n- You can turn captcha protection on/off using the commands /enable and /disable.\n\n- Configuration commands can only be used by group Administrators.\n\n- You can change the language that I speak, using the command /language.\n\n- You can configure captcha difficulty level using command /difficulty.\n\n- You can set captcha to use just numbers (default) or full numbers and letters, using command /captcha_mode.\n\n- You can configure a custom welcome message with command /welcome_msg.\n\n- Check /commands to get a list of all avaliable commands, and a short description of all of them.",
