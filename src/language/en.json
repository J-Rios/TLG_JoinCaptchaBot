Also, any message that contains an URL sent by a new \"user\" before the captcha is completed will be considered spam and will be deleted.\n\nRemember to give me administration privileges to kick-ban users and remove messages.\n\nCheck /help command for more information about my usage.\n\nAm I useful? Check /about command and consider making a donation to keep me active.",
